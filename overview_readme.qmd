## Home

The **Home** page serves as the landing section for *MetaOmixTools*, offering:

-   **General description**: A concise panel explaining the purpose and scope of *MetaOmixTools*, highlighting its role in simplifying multi-study omics analysis.
-   **Citation panel**: Recommended format to acknowledge the suite in publications, ensuring proper credit to the development team.
-   **Institutional link**: A linkable *CIPF* logo directing to the official website of the *Centro de Investigación Príncipe Felipe*.
-   **Interactive showcase**: This section displays side-by-side cards for *MetaRank* and *MetaEnrichGO*. Each tool is represented by a logo with hover effects that reveal the following details:
    -   Short description of the tool’s main purpose.
    -   Supported input file types.
    -   Allowed output formats.
    -   A dedicated button that links directly to the corresponding tool interface.

## MetaRank

The **MetaRank** section loads the *MetaRank* tool, which enables consensus ranking of genes from multiple ordered gene lists derived from different studies or technologies.

-   **Input**: Accepts gene lists through file upload (`TSV`/`CSV`/`TXT`) or direct paste into a text area.
-   **Meta-analysis algorithms**: Offers both weighted and unweighted ranking methods, including *RankProd* and *RobustRankAggreg*.
-   **Filters**: Allows customization of gene inclusion criteria, such the minimum number of occurrences in lists and missing value management. In addition, it allows to apply an enrichment analysis to up to the first 100 genes in the list.
-   **Output**: Provides downloadable results including ranked tables in `CSV` or `TSV` formats and graphical summaries in `PNG`, `JPG` or `HTML` formats.

<br>

## MetaEnrichGO

The **MetaEnrichGO** section gives access to functional enrichment analysis based on multiple user-supplied lists derived from different studies or technologies.

-   **Input**: Supports only `TXT` format, either uploaded or pasted.
-   **Ontology options**: Includes Gene Ontology terms or custom annotation inputs via TERM2GENE and TERM2NAME tables.
-   **Parameters**: Users can adjust the enrichment parameters, such as the organism, the minimum number of occurrences in lists or the database used, since in addition to *GO*, it is possible to use *KEGG* and *Reactome*.
-   **Output**: Provides downloadable results of enrichment tables in `CSV` or `TSV` formats and graphical summaries in `PNG`, `JPG` or `HTML` formats.

## About

The `About` dropdown provides essential support and additional materials to enhance user experience:

### Instructions

Comprehensive documentation for every section of the suite:

-   **Overview**: This page, outlining the general navigation, layout, and primary components of *MetaOmixTools*.
