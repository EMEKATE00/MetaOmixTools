## System and data preparation Questions

1. How do I pre-process my gene lists for optimal results? <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-primary rounded-pill ms-2" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#faq7" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq7" style="float: right;">Show Answer</button>  
   <div class="collapse mt-2 mb-4" id="faq7"><div class="card card-body">
   Each tool provides an info button next to the file upload area that displays a small example of the optimal list format, along with concise instructions. If you paste your lists directly, the placeholder text defines the required structure—each list separated by ###. You can also download example files for a deeper look at the format. The tools automatically remove duplicates and NAs, but you must still use the official gene nomenclature for your organism.

2. Can I save and load analysis sessions? <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-primary rounded-pill ms-auto" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#faq8" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq8" style="float: right;">Show Answer</button>  
   <div class="collapse mt-2 mb-4" id="faq8"><div class="card card-body">
   Session saving is not yet supported. Download your result tables and export plots when done. Future releases may include project-based session management.
   </div></div>

<div style="height: 10px;"></div>

3. Is there a limit on the number of gene lists or the size of each list? <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-primary rounded-pill ms-2" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#faq9" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq9" style="float: right;">Show Answer</button>  
   <div class="collapse mt-2 mb-4" id="faq9"><div class="card card-body">
   There is no strict cap on how many gene lists you can upload or how many genes each list can contain—our example files range from 200 to 25,000 genes—bear in mind that processing time tends to increase once you work with more than around 30 lists.
   </div></div>
   
<div style="height: 10px;"></div>

4. What download formats are available for graphics and tables? <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-primary rounded-pill ms-2" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#faq2" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq2" style="float: right;">Show Answer</button>  
   <div class="collapse mt-2 mb-4" id="faq2"><div class="card card-body">
   You can export graphics in PNG, JPG, or HTML. PNG offers transparent backgrounds for publications, JPG has a solid background, and HTML provides interactive plots. Tables are available in CSV or TSV, ready to use in tools like Excel, R, or Python.
   </div></div>

<div style="height: 10px;"></div>

5. How does the customization of graphics and tables work? <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-primary rounded-pill ms-2" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#faq5" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq5" style="float: right;">Show Answer</button>  
   <div class="collapse mt-2 mb-4" id="faq5"><div class="card card-body">
   Each module includes a panel where you can filter table columns and adjust graph settings like colors, fonts, and size. In MetaEnrichGO, you can also select how many terms to display. All changes update instantly, and charts reflect filtered table content automatically.

## Tool Usage and Technical Questions

6. Is the enrichment method used in both tools the same?
  <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-primary rounded-pill ms-auto" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#faq1" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq1" style="float: right;"> Show Answer </button> <div class="collapse mt-2 mb-4" id="faq1"> <div class="card card-body"> Both tools use the same annotation sources, but their analytical approaches differ. MetaRank generates a single consensus gene list based on ranking agreement across inputs, and performs enrichment on the top 100 genes. MetaEnrichGO, in contrast, analyzes all genes from all input lists and applies an additional meta-analysis step to combine p-values across results. As a result, MetaEnrichGO outputs include an appearance column indicating in how many input files each gene associated with a term was found, while MetaRank focuses on genes selected through consensus ranking. </div> </div>

<div style="height: 10px;"></div>

7. Why are excluded genes included in the report? <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-primary rounded-pill ms-2" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#faq3" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq3" style="float: right;">Show Answer</button>  
   <div class="collapse mt-2 mb-4" id="faq3"><div class="card card-body">
   To ensure transparency, excluded genes are listed separately with a brief explanation—typically due to low recurrence across lists—so users can understand why they weren’t part of the main analysis.
   </div></div>

<div style="height: 10px;"></div>

8. Why are the selected methods used in MetaRank? <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-primary rounded-pill ms-2" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#faq6" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq6" style="float: right;">Show Answer</button>  
   <div class="collapse mt-2 mb-4" id="faq6"><div class="card card-body">
   These two methods were selected because they offer complementary approaches—one weighted (RankProd) and one unweighted (RobustRankAggreg)—while meeting key criteria: straightforward integration into the codebase, clear documentation, flexible parameter settings, efficient performance, and the ability to handle large datasets reliably.
   </div></div>

<div style="height: 10px;"></div>
  
9. Why does MetaRank automatically exclude genes that appear only once? <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-primary rounded-pill ms-2" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#faq4" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq4" style="float: right;">Show Answer</button>  
   <div class="collapse mt-2 mb-4" id="faq4"><div class="card card-body">
   Genes present in a single list lack robust evidence and can bias the consensus ranking. Imputation (e.g., median) would assign identical scores to singletons, possibly elevating them unfairly. Exclusion yields a more reliable ranking.
   </div></div>

<div style="height: 10px;"></div>

10. What is the meta-analysis method used in MetaEnrichGO? <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-primary rounded-pill ms-2" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#faq10" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq10" style="float: right;">Show Answer</button>  
   <div class="collapse mt-2 mb-4" id="faq10"><div class="card card-body">
   The meta-analysis method in MetaEnrichGO combines p-values from multiple enrichment analyses to provide a more robust evaluation of the biological term relevance. It uses a statistical technique to combine results from different gene lists, allowing the identification of common terms that are significantly enriched across all lists. This approach improves the accuracy of the analysis by reducing the bias that might arise from variability between different datasets.
